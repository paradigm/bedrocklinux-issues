    Here's my proposed layout at the moment:
    
    It will be mounted at /bedrock/clientinfo.
    
    It will contain a directory with each client, and one called "self" which is a
    symlink to the client which provides the command that is parsing clientinfo
    
    Within each directory will be several files:
    
     - name.  This will print name of the client.  This is useful so people can
     read /bedrock/clientinfo/self/name to replace "bri -n"
    
     - path.  This will print the path to the client from the absolute root.
    
     - setup.  This will indicate whether the client has mount items within it set
     up.  It can provide several values, including: one which indicates all mounts
     are properly set, one which indicates none of the mounts are set, and one for
     the situation where only some are set.  Possibly add name cache information as
     well.  Additionally, perhaps we could have root write to this to set up mounts
     to replace brs command, as is sometimes used in /sys.
    
     - cmds.  This will list all of the commands provided by the client.
    
    other ideas for what to include here are welcome.
