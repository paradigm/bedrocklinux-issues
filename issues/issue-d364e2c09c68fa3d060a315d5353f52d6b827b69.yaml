title: brpathfs
desc: |-
  It is easy to forget to update the brpath with brp, which occasionally runs
  into issues.  Instead, perhaps we could create a virtual filesystem, a la
  /proc, for the brpath which will regenerate the needed files on the fly.  This
  could be done with FUSE to avoid requiring the user manually patch/compile the
  kernel.
