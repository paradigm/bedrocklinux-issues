    - While it still has quite a few issues, Appa is far enough along to function for day-to-day use.  It sufficiently demonstrates that the idea behind Bedrock Linux is quite feasible.

      Soon after Appa went public, a number of issues were made apparent.  Momo is intended to polish these issues out and should suffice until the next big release is available.
