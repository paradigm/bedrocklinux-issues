    <cory_> paradigm: I am interested in taking on the updater for bedrock. Should I just claim it on the issue tracker and submit a pull request or would you like to discuss it first?
    <paradigm> We should probably discuss it either way
    <paradigm> I didn't seem to put up my thoughts on the matter, which I probably should have
    <paradigm> What I had in mind was that core components could be updated by compiling as needed *or* by grabbing them from a client distro as it updates them
    <paradigm> So if busybox-static updates, grab that busybox
    <paradigm> also support yanking a client's kernel
    <paradigm> Alternatively, if the user doesn't use a client for something like that, compile
    <paradigm> That about what you had in mind?  I'm certainly open to suggestion, especially if someone else is going to try to tackle the issue
    <cory_> I like the idea of pulling in available updates from clients. I was thinking of keeping it all self contained by using utilities that are already in busybox.
    <paradigm> sounds perfect to me
    <paradigm> will still have to go out to a client for things like gcc to compile things that aren't available from a client, such as if the user prefers to compile his or her own busybox or kernel
    <paradigm> Note eventually there will likely be a package manager manager that the updater will be pulled into, but its still a ways away
    <cory_> ic, will probably utilize utilities from bedrock for finding the needed build software 
    <paradigm> sounds good to me
    <cory_> I will keep that in mind
