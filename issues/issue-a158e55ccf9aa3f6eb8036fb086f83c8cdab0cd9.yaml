title: daemon to sync /etc files
desc: |-
  One potential solution for syncing /etc is to have a daemon detect when one of
  the clients had a file updated and sync the file with the other clients.
  Perhaps inotify could be used.

    Various thoughts:
    
    - It will probably have to be in C since busybox doesn't come with any inotify tools.
    
    - Exactly what files are being watched should be configurable somewhere.
    
    - There is a potential problem when multiple items are updated too soon.  To
    resolve this:
    
      - the program should make diff/patch style changes to files rather than fully
      overwrite them, so files that are altered in quick sequence will remain
      unlike the original
      - the program could keep a backup somewhere else of the files to diff against
      immediately before changing
      - if, after running through all of the files that need to be changed, the
      program noticies that they're still not identical (because something changed
      while it was working), it can repeat the process of diffing to figure out
      what is different and patching the rest of the files.
